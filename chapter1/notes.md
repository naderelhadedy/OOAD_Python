## Great Software in 3 easy steps

1- Make sure your software does what the customer wants it to do.

> This step focuses on the customer. 
Make sure the app does what it’s 
supposed to do FIRST. This is 
where getting good requirements 
and doing some analysis comes in.

2- Apply basic OO principles to add flexibility.

> Once your software works, you 
can look for any duplicate code 
that might have slipped in, and 
make sure you’re using good OO 
programming techniques.

3- Strive for a maintainable, reusable design.

> Got a good object-oriented 
app that does what it should? 
It’s time to apply patterns and 
principles to make sure your 
software is ready to use for 
years to come.

you’re trying to solve to make sure that 
your design lines up with the intended 
functionality of your application.

- Encapsulation 
allows you to 
hide the inner 
workings of your 
application’s 
parts, but yet 
make it clear 
what each part 
does.

- Anytime you see 
duplicate code, look for a 
place to encapsulate!

operation to another object, to be performed on
