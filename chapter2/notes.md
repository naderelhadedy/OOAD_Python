# Ch.2 Gathering Requirements

> Give Them What They Want


## Quotes

- Requirement. A requirement is a singular need detailing 
what a particular product or service should be or do. 
It is most commonly used in a formal sense in 
systems engineering or software engineering.

- The best 
way to 
get good 
requirements 
is to 
understand 
what a 
system is 
supposed 
to do.

- Alternate paths handle system problems.

- A use case describes 
what
your system 
does
to accomplish a 
particular 
customer goal.

- Use case. A use case is a technique for capturing the 
potential requirements of a new system or software change. 
Each use case provides one or more scenarios that convey how 
the system should interact with the end user or another 
system to achieve a specific goal.

- Check your requirements 
against your use cases.

- Your 
system 
must 
work in 
the real 
world...
...so plan 
and test 
for when 
things go 
wrong.

## One use case, three parts

There are three basic parts to a good use case, and you need all three if your use case is going to get the job done;


1- Clear Value

> Every use case must have a clear 
value to the system. If the use case 
doesn’t help the customer achieve their 
goal, then the use case isn’t of much use.

2- Start and Stop

> Every use case must have a definite
starting and stopping point. Something 
must begin the process, and then there must be a 
condition that indicates that the process is complete.

3- External Initiator

> Every use case is started off by an external 
initiator, outside of the system. Sometimes 
that initiator is a person, but it could be 
anything outside of the system.
